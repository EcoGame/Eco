The simulation game of nations

## Usage

Building is done through `compi.sh`, so you need a way to run a shell
script. Any terminal should work on \*nix systems, on Windows you
should install cygwin and another operating system ;)

compi.sh usage:

`compi.sh [operation]`

* No operation (default) - build, run, then clean

* `build` - just build the project

* `run` - run existing binaries

* `clean` - clean up binaries and any files created by the project

### Controls

W, A, S, and D - Move the camera within the XZ plane

Space - Move the camera upwards

Left Shift - Move the camera downwards

O - Toggle camera mode between overhead and horizontal 

Q - Re-align the camera back to the default position

R and F - Rotate the camera
